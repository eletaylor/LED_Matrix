TPS66121

Want PPHV current protection
Want VBUS overvoltage protection 
- how to set the level? Absolute max rating from LED datsheet is 5.3, set to 5.0
- use voltage divider (p11 for eqn)
VLDO default powered by VIN, tie VIN and VBUS together anyway, use VLDO? I think we only want PPHV
- It says ground VIN if unused

See pg 20 for application example

VLDO cap - 2.5uF
PPHV cap - unspecified, maybe not necessary? system is very capacitive
VBUS cap - at least 10uF, put close to the USBC connector
Forgo VBUS TVS protection
Place Shottky diode (NSR20F30NXTG) from VBUS to GND

VIN  - gnd if unused?
VLDO - gnd if unused?
FLT  - NC, unused
EN0  - set to 1 to put the IC in the sink state
OVP  - voltage divider 102k/20k
