Want PPHV current protection
Want VBUS overvoltage protection 
- how to set the level? Absolute max rating from LED datsheet is 5.3, set to 5.0
- use voltage divider (p11 for eqn)
VLDO default powered by VIN, tie VIN and VBUS together anyway, use VLDO? I think we only want PPHV
See pg 20 for application example

VLDO cap - 2.5uF
PPHV cap - unspecified, maybe not necessary? system is very capacitive
VBUS cap - at least
